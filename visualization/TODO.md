# Simulation
- [x] Make simulation 3D
- [x] Convert ECEF coordinates to geodetic and store geodetic coordinates to fit the WorldWind position definition
- [ ] Redo simulation in Rust so that it can be compiled into web assembly and ran directly in the page

# Launch visualization
- [ ] Read points from the Python generated CSV
- [ ] Syncronize simulation time with animation time
- [ ] Draw launch trajectory based on simulation time

# Console log
- [ ] Basic console log
- [ ] Colored logs
